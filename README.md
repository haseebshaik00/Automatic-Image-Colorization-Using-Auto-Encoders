# Introduction

This paper tends to the issue of producing a conceivable hued photo given a grayscale picture. Past ways to deal with tackle this issue have either depended on human inputs in the form of scribbles and hints or resulted in desaturated colorizations. Motivated by [20], we present a completely programmed approach that utilizes profound neural systems to image colorization. We investigate the convolutional neural network space, the optimizers, regularization techniques and learning rate scheduling to comprehend the viable procedures to acquire acceptable colorized images as our output. We train a convolutional neural system and provide an image colourization solution that retains the dimensions of the image. Our model aims to have the same input and output image size. We additionally examine other cutting-edge research done in the field that led us to generating satisfying images with low error rates, including conditional generative adversarial networks [19]. At last, we give a subjective furthermore, visual examination of our outcomes and plots to accompany them, finishing up with roads for future exploration.
